WordPress REST API Authentication secures rest API access for unauthorized users using OAuth 2.0, Basic Auth, jwt, API Key methods. Also reduces potential attack factors to the respective site. 

== Description ==

Wordpress REST API Authentication plugin secures the unauthorized access to your WordPress site using different authentication credentials verification. This plugin doesn't requires much configuration.

There are multiple ways to secure a REST APIs e.g. basic auth, OAuth, JWT etc. but one thing is sure that RESTful APIs should be stateless â€“ so request authentication/authorization should not depend on cookies or sessions. Instead, each API request should come with some sort authentication credentials which must be validated on the server for each and every request.

The plugin will also define the security levels of WordPress REST APIs according to the authentication method you choose. OAuth 2.0 authentication method prefers for the higher security of it.

= How to access draft posts? =
	You can access draft posts using Basic Auth, OAuth 2.0(using Username:Password) methods. Pages/posts are need to access with the status. Default status used in request is 'Publish' and any user can access Published post. 
	To access the pages/posts stored in draft, you need to append the ?status=draft to the page/post request.
	For Example:
	You need to use below URL format while sending request to access different type of posts
	1. Access draft posts only
		https://localhost:8080/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?status=draft
